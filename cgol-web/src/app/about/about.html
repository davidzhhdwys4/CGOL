<h3>About the app</h3>
<p>
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia article</a> for more information.
This app is served from my <a href="https://github.com/davidzhhdwys4/CGOL">github repo</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why make this?</h3>
This app is a combined tutorial of the following tools:
<ul>
  <li>Angular</li>
  <li>Angular Material</li>
  <li>Rust and WebAssembly</li>
  <li>IndexedDB via Dexie.js</li>
  <li>Github Actions</li>
</ul>

The app uses the angular framework and angular material components for the frontend.
The backend logic of the game is implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, and the game states are saved in the browser's IndexedDB using Dexie.js.

There is an angular service worker that enables offline support. Try turning on airplane mode and refreshing the page - the app will still load!
In Edge and Chrome, you can also install the app as a PWA (Progressive Web App) by clicking the install button in the address bar.
